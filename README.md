# Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Product Reviews
It is increasingly common that Internet users engage in various of online reviews. The availability of these review content offers researchers opportunities to better understand and model online social behavior. In this project, I conducted sentiment analysis to gain some understanding about the Amazon product reviews.

## Dataset
I analyzed the review contents from Amazon Product Data provided by Julian McAuley at http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/. This dataset contains product reviews and metadata from Amazon, including 142.8 million reviews spanning May 1996 â€“ July 2014. It includes reviews (ratings, text, helpfulness votes), product metadata (descriptions, category information, price, brand, and image features), and links (also viewed/also bought graphs).

For the tasks, we will use only 5-core subsets of three categories (Baby / Clothing, Shoes and Jewelry / Health and Personal Care). 5-core subsets mean that all users and items in the dataset have at least 5 reviews. Originally, the dataset was a zipped file of json format and the content was arranged in dictionaries. For your convenience, the dataset was modified into text file and is available for download: Baby.txt.
