# Sentiment Analysis of Amazon Product Reviews
It is increasingly common that Internet users engage in various of online reviews. The availability of these review content offers researchers opportunities to better understand and model online social behavior. In this project, I conducted sentiment analysis to gain some understanding about the Amazon product reviews.

## Dataset
I analyzed the review contents from Amazon Product Data provided by Julian McAuley at http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/. This dataset contains product reviews and metadata from Amazon, including 142.8 million reviews spanning May 1996 â€“ July 2014. It includes reviews (ratings, text, helpfulness votes), product metadata (descriptions, category information, price, brand, and image features), and links (also viewed/also bought graphs).
